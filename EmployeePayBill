/* Write a program to calculate the gross salary of a group of employees. Basic salary should be taken from the user.
   If the basic salary is greater than 15000 ,HRA=20% and DA=60% will be given, else HRA=3000 and DA 70% will be given to the employee.
   Note: Input of basic salary will be taken from the keyboard. 
   After calculating the salary of one employee, the program will ask for the user's choice as int. 
   If “-1” is entered then the loop will continue and the loop will exit for other int inputs.
