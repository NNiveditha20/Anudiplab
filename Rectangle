/* ● Write a Java program that uses a method to calculate the area of a rectangle and compare them using Relational Operator Steps:
   ● Create a class Rectangle. 
   ● The Rectangle class should have two attributes length and width of type int. 
   ● Create a constructor that accepts length and width as parameters.
   ● Area should be calculated as length*width.
   ● Instantiate two Rectangle classes with random values.
   ● Compare the areas of the two rectangles using the Relational Operator. 
   ● If the first one is bigger than the second one, print “Rectangle1 > Rectangle2”. 
   ● If the first one is smaller print “Rectangle1 < Rectangle2”. 
   ● Otherwise print “They are equal”.
