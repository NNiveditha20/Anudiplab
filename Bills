/* Write a program which calculates the monthly bill amount for a internet subscriber based on the following logic:
    1) If the total data consumed is less than 10 GB then bill amount will be Rs. 300. (Basic charge)
    2) If the data consumed is between 10 GB and 30 GB then bill amount will be basic charge + 5* (Total GB consumed - 10).
       That means consumers will be charged Rs 5 for each additional GB consumed over 10 GB.
    3) If the consumer consumes more than 30 GB then The bill amount = 400 + 3 *(Total GB consumed - 30).
       That means the consumer has to pay additional Rs 3 for each GB above 30GB.
    Use if-else block to solve the problem
