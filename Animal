/*  Write a Java program that demonstrates method overriding by creating a superclass called Animal and two subclasses called Dog and Cat. 
    ● The Animal class should have a method called makeSound(), which simply prints "The animal makes a sound." 
    ● The Dog and Cat classes should override this method to print "TheCat/The dog meows/barks" respectively. 
    ● The program should allow the user to create and display objects of each
*/

Code 1:

package anudip;

public class Animal {

	 public void makeSound() {
		 
		 System.out.println("The animal makes a sound.");
		 
		 }
		}

		class Dog extends Animal {
			
		 public void makeSound() {
			 
		 System.out.println("The dog barks.");
		 
		 }
		}
		
		class Cat extends Animal {
			
		 public void makeSound() {
			 
		 System.out.println("The cat meows.");
		 }

	
}


Code 2:

package anudip;

public class Animal1 {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		 Animal animal = new Animal();
		 
		 Dog dog = new Dog();
		 Cat cat = new Cat();
		 
		 System.out.print("Animal sounds:");
		 animal.makeSound();
		 
		 System.out.print("\nDog sounds:");
		 dog.makeSound();
		 
		 System.out.print("\nCat sounds:");
		 cat.makeSound();
		 
		 }

}
